        1. No spam!
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        2. No bigotry! But, have a sense of humor, people. If something is a joke, its a joke. If someone is upset by something said, we'll act accordingly on a case-by-case basis. Some things are just not meant to be said. That said, we like offensive jokes here. If you don't, we aren't the community for you.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        3. No pornographic/adult/other NSFW material. No suggestive themes either. We have minors in the chat, use your damn brain you degenerate. (Thirst trapping acceptable, but do not ask for, nor tell the sauce. Keep your mouth shut.)
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        4. No offensive names and profile pictures.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        5. No sharing or distributing hacks, cheats, or other unauthorized tools or services. This may be a PvE game, but people work hard for what they have. If you're a cheater, we don't like you, we don't want you. Piss off.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        6. Keep political and religious discussions civil and respectful. We don't mind talking about these things here but the very moment it gets out of hand, everyone's getting muted. If it becomes a problem, trust, it won't be for long.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        7. Do not intentionally disrupt conversations or create a hostile environment for other users. This includes trolling, flaming, or excessive arguing.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        8. Do not share graphic or disturbing content such as gore, violence, or explicit sexual content.        
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        9. No blackmail, threats, or harassment. Do not engage in blackmail, threats, or harassment of any kind, whether in public or private messages. You will be considered for an instant ban. We do not tolerate friendly fire here, in game, or out.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        10. No recruiting for other servers or communities. Do not recruit or promote other servers or communities in this server without prior approval from the server staff.
    </div>
